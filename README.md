## General Information
- **Project Description**: This project involves a multiple linear regression analysis to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes. The analysis aims to help BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, to identify the variables significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands.
- **Background**: BoomBikes has suffered considerable revenue dips due to the ongoing pandemic. The company seeks to develop a business plan to accelerate its revenue post-lockdown.
- **Business Problem**: Identify significant variables influencing bike-sharing demand and understand their impact.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes daily bike-sharing data with variables such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, month, weekday, working day status, and weather situation.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8
- Libraries:
  - numpy - version 1.19.2
  - pandas - version 1.1.3
  - matplotlib - version 3.3.2
  - seaborn - version 0.11.0
  - sklearn - version 0.23.2
  - statsmodels - version 0.12.1

## Conclusions
1. **Temperature**: Positively correlated with bike demand.
2. **Season**: Spring and winter show significant influence on bike demand.
3. **Month**: July and September have a noticeable impact on bike demand.
4. **Weather Situation**: Bad weather conditions significantly reduce bike demand.
5. **Year**: Shows a strong positive correlation, indicating increasing demand over time.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to understand the impact of various factors on bike-sharing demand during the pandemic.
